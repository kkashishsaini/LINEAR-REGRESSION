# LINEAR-REGRESSION
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.
IT IS A REGRESSION BASED SUPERVISED TYPE OF MACHINE LEARNING 
LINEAR REGRESSION IS PURELY A REGRESSION SUPERVISED LEARNING PROBLEM.
IN SUCH TYPE OF PROBLEM LABELLED DATA SET IS GIVEN. IN LINEAR REGRESSION THE BEST FIT LINE IS CHOSEN, WHICH COVERS THE MAXIMUM SPREAD OF THE DATA SET. 
HERE, THE POINTS THAT DON’T LIE ON THE LINE ARE PROJECTED ON THE LINE TO PRODUCE A CERTAIN VALUE THAT IS NOT REAL (NOT EXACT VALUE). 

HENCE, ACTUAL VALUE – PREDICATED VALUE = MEAN SQUARED ERROR. 
THE MEAN SQUARED ERROR SHOULD BE MINIMUM TO GET THE MAXIMUM POINT ON THE BEST FIT LINE. 
IN THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM, THE CLASS LABEL IS NEVER FIXED, INSTEAD, IT IS ANY REAL NUMBER. 

 
When working with linear regression, our main goal is to find the best fit line which means the error between predicted values and actual values should be minimized. The best fit line will have the least error.
